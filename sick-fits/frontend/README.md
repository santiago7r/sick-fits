# Fullstack Advanced React and GraphQL - Sick Fits Project

Welcome to the **Fullstack Advanced React and GraphQL** project! This repository contains the code and resources for building a full-stack eCommerce application, Sick Fits, using modern React.js and GraphQL.

## Project Overview

This project is based on the course from **AdvancedReact.com**, which teaches you how to build a fully functional full-stack application with **React.js** and **GraphQL**.

In this project, you will learn to create an online store called **Sick Fits**, complete with product listings, user authentication, and the ability to upload photos, handle payments, and much more. The application is built with **React.js** on the frontend and a **GraphQL API** powered by **Node.js** on the backend.

## Features

- **GraphQL API**: Built with Node.js, providing robust query and mutation capabilities for our application.
- **React & Apollo**: The frontend is built with modern React.js, integrated with Apollo Client for efficient data fetching using GraphQL.
- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication, including signup, login, and account management.
- **Email Sending**: Automatic email sending functionality for notifications and user interaction.
- **File Upload**: Uploading images such as product photos with cloud storage.
- **Caching**: Efficient data caching with Apollo Client to minimize redundant data fetching.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with nearly six hours of dedicated testing content to ensure the robustness of your application.
